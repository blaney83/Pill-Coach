    Administrator access:
        If a user had Admin access, the modal displayed to the user would have a button for adding data. In much of the same way that Wikipedia allows contributions, a trusted user (upon being presented with an "empty" page) could follow the provided link to an external source (like webMD or WikiPedia), and copy information pertaining to the empty section. Side effects, for example, could be copied and then the user could click the button on the modal, insert the additional information, and hit submit to write or "update" the missing area in the db.
